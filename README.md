Intelligent Tutor
=================

Overview
--------

The Intelligent Tutor is an AI-driven system designed to support **effective, personalized learning**. Its MVP emphasizes the most impactful contributors to learning outcomes: clear goals, adaptive content, and effortful retrieval practice.

Core Principles
---------------

-   **Goal Alignment**: Learning paths are broken into subcomponents within a knowledge map.

-   **Personalization**: Content adapts to learner goals, curiosity, progress, and available attention.

-   **Mastery Learning**: Material builds systematically on what the learner has already mastered.

-   **Effortful Retrieval**: Frequent, mixed, and increasingly challenging review sessions reinforce memory through the testing and spacing effects.

MVP Features
------------

1.  **Knowledge Map Generation**

    -   Given a learner's goal, generate a roadmap/graph of key knowledge components.

    -   Structure content in a sequence that supports mastery and scaffolding.

2.  **Content Recommendation**

    -   Recommend abundant instructional material aligned to:

        -   *Goals*: targeted resources for each knowledge component.

        -   *Interests*: curiosity-driven motivating material.

        -   *Progress*: adaptive sequencing that builds upon prior work.

        -   *Practical considerations*: match media type to learner context (e.g., podcasts for passive attention, problem sets for focused sessions).

3.  **Assessment & Retrieval Practice**

    -   Generate practical recall questions with minimal cues.

    -   Enable mixed-topic practice sessions with spaced intervals that grow over time.

4.  **Interactive Interfaces**

    -   **Knowledge Map UI**: visualize learning goals and subcomponents.

    -   **Assessment Interface**: practice questions with feedback.

    -   **Tutor Context**: AI tutor receives both content and learner profile for adaptive support.

5.  **Knowledge Tracing (MVP level)**

    -   Update learner models using assessments and conversations.

    -   Provide tutor with evolving context of learner's strengths, gaps, and history.

Development Priorities
----------------------

1.  Deliver working loop: *Goal → Knowledge Map → Content → Assessment → Recommendation*.

2.  Validate effectiveness with learners before optimizing advanced pedagogy or fine-tuning.
